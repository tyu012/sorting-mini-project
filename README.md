# Comments about AI usage in designing my algorithm
I begin the chat by asking how I can combine merge sort and quicksort.
I liked that the LLM provided me with a "skeleton" of the code that will let me do this,
which reduces the amount of time I need.
From here, I was able to create wrapper methods that sorted partitions.
I was also wondering how to find the best threshold value to know when to use a sorting algorithm,
but I felt like I knew that I should show it experimentally.
 
Altogether, I didn't find the AI to be very useful, since I already have a general idea of what
I am trying to do.
I think that I need to give more specific prompts to the AI for it to actually describe the
implementations. If not, I don't get examples of specific implementations.
 
One thing that I found useful was being able to ask questions about what methods to use for
doing an experiment.
For example, I can ask the AI for classes which allow me to time how fast the algorithm runs.
